I went to Thailand on a trip and found the area and the cabs stopping to be very shady. I was a bit inebriated and wanted to make sure I didn’t end up somewhere else. I took a picture of the plate and sent it to my sister and let her know what company this cab was just in case anything untoward happened. Weirdly enough -  i realised a couple of hours later that had I left my shawl in the cab as I got off. Because I had the picture of the number plate I was able to retrieve it from the cab company. I called them as soon as I found out I had lost my item and because I had the cab plate details they could locate it instantly! Handed some cash to the cab driver as a thank you.

"Disclaimer: This is not my method, I read it somewhere a couple years ago and can’t find it so I wanted to share.

Step 1: Inhale through your mouth as deeply as possible.  You don’t have to keep trying to suck in more air but you want your lungs to be nearly full.

Step 2: Swallow twice.  This can be difficult.  Sometimes taking a small sip of water before you start step 1 and keeping it in your mouth will provide enough liquid for your mouth to swallow as it is tricky to swallow air for some.  Try swallowing back to back as fast as possible.  If there is any more than a second or so between swallows, start again at step 1.

Step 3: SLOWLY SLOWLY SLOWLY exhale through your nose.  You may feel a bit light headed toward the end and you can stop there or keep going for good measure.  Just don’t pass out.

"Hey everyone. Hope today is going great! 
Going to cut straight to it though, hope it's not too sloppy because I'm typing this off the top of my head; 

Just turned 22 this year and it got me thinking about my life. It seems like I have a real knack for music production/writing. I started writing stories when I was young and started writing lyrics to hip hop instrumentals when I was 16 and actually started putting out music(which is now deleted) on my then SoundCloud page. It got really good responses from my classmates and some negative feedback from others(more good than bad). Then when I turned 18 I started producing my own beats/learning music theory.  I started to like production more than writing so I decided to just go with it and became a ""producer"" I made a YouTube page and ended up getting 700+ subscribers in a year or so(will link my page later) Ended up forming a group with my buddies and turned to DJing (both my buddies Dj in East Lansing, MI while attending college there) Fast forward a year later (now I'm about 20) and we are getting booked almost every weekend at bars and other venues around Lansing and also we get booked to perform at Prime Music Festival. (Look it up if you don't believe me, I and my buddies went by INRWRX) 

A month after the festival I and my buddies decide that the ride was fun but ultimately we wanted to create ""different types of music"" and ended up splitting(still good friends) now at this same time my girlfriend of 7+ years broke up with me( her parents/she didn't like I wasn't going to school and kinda just being a drifter and making music, also we both just wanted different things out of life) also around this time my Dad was frequently overdosing on drugs and my mom fled to Alabama with her at the time boyfriend. I became really depressed and suicidal for a long time. From 20 years old to just recently this year has just been a big chaotic depressive episode. 
I haven't made music in about a year. I haven't uploaded beats to my YouTube in about 2 years and I also am very isolated now. I find myself always just wasting my time on dumb shit like my video games or on my phone and am never in the mood to do the things I like anymore. It seems like when I want to make music ill just end up playing my game for hours and hours almost as if I'm avoiding something and when I do find the time to sit down and make music I find myself getting frustrated and stopping really quickly. 

Idk I guess I'm just looking for some life pro tips? 
I feel really lost right now.

Storing the number online in a cloud or something else is also helpful if you are on a holiday and can't look it up. 
Also: tracking apps are not useful because a thief will shut your phone off within 1 second after he got his dirty hands onto it.

The IMEI can allows the police to locate the phone or lock that phone out of the network by your phone carrier. If you dont have the number your phone is lost 100%. Every day that passes without them knowing the number decreases your chance of getting it back.

Not gonna lie, at the beginning I was pissed at that, but I soon realised that they are not trying to hurt me. I talked with them about it and they just told me that they would have never thought that I might have a problem with it, since I'm not that short. One of them even said that I'm quite attractive so for him making fun of my appearance was a good way to go, to not hurt me, but to still be funny.

And then I thought about the jokes I make about them. One of them is a ginger and I sometimes make fun of him not having a soul. The reason why I do this is because I don't think it's bad to be a ginger, so I never really thought that it might hurt or bother him, but it did.

" 

My 2013 Honda Civic had 3 lights come on at the same time. I took it to my local trustworthy mechanic because my car is out of warranty. After a few days with the car he said he could not figure out the problem, and I needed to take it to a dealership. My internet research led me to believe that it was my VSA Modulator (about a $1600 repair that needs to be installed by dealership computers). I took my car to a local Honda Dealer, and they told me my Car needed a brand new Wire Harness, for $2500. He said they tested it and it showed no connectivity. He also said this was most likely the first step in the process, and after the wire harness the VSA modulator would probably need to be replaced. They insisted that they would not do the VSA modulator without the new wire harness. Almost a $5000 bill after New York Tax. I paid my $100 diagnostic fee and got out of there with a sick feeling in my stomach.

I rushed across town to another dealership for a second opinion. They immediately told me the other dealership was lying to me, because my Wire Harness was 100% completely fine. They replaced the VSA modulator for $1600 and my car has been completely fixed since. I called the first dealership back told them I wanted a refund for my diagnostic. The manager didn't even hesitate, and they sent me a check.

First, create a few resumes concentrating on different groups of experience in your career.

Instead, you create different versions - all true - which will focus on different aspects of your experience. For example, if you grew from a junior developer to a director level role in an IT organization, you may need a resume focus on your project management skills, one focused on your development skills, one on your specific IT area management.

Second tier is further customizing your resume to a specific job description you're applying for. This will increase your chances of getting your resume past ATCs (Applicant Tracking Systems) and in front of a real person.

"Your cable company will typically add an extra $10-15 USD per month to your bill as an ""equipment rental fee"" for the modem they provided you. However, most ISPs allow you to go out and buy your own modem and install it. A basic new home modem and/or router might cost anywhere in the neighborhood of $60-120 USD depending on the speed/specifications, but this also means that after about 4 months to a year at most, the modem will have paid for itself and everything from there will be an extra $120-180 back in your pocket every year, and if you decide to move, you will own the modem and can bring it with you to your new address.  Not all modem models may be allowed by your ISP. In my experience, most ISPs have a list of approved modem models on their website that you can look up via web search (i.e. search ""\[name of ISP\] approved modems"") before buying a modem.   
Once you have the modem and/or router, some ISPs even have self-setup procedures that you can use to activate the new modem yourself at home without having someone come to your house to install it (again, the exact installation procedure may be found online on the ISP's website). In addition to no longer being charged a monthly fee, the equipment you buy yourself may be faster, have better WIFI range, and be more reliable than the often pre-owned or refurbished equipment provided by the ISP. You will then likely have to return the old modem at a customer service center or mail it back to your ISP to have the monthly charge taken off your bill.","LPT: If your cable modem or WIFI router at home was provided by your ISP, you are likely being charged a monthly fee.

"EndNote Basic is **FREE** to use and very effectively organizes your references (link in comments). Most articles (at least ones I find using my University's database, or google scholar) allow you to export citations for the article.

" They tell you to dispose of perfectly good contacts so that you'd pay for a pair every day, which is very expensive. In reality, daily contacts are quite durable and can be worn as monthlies: they are slightly thinner (which is the only difference in manufacturing) and CAN rip a little faster, but hey! They are also much, much cheaper, so you will not shed any tears when you have to get rid of a pair.

 

Thinner contacts may be problematic for those with dry eyes (like myself), but there are plenty of brands that retain moisture. I do not use any eyedrops, and never feel any discomfort. 

&amp;#x200B;

I  have been wearing mine until they are no longer comfortable (often, well over a month). Currently, I use about 20 pairs a year (I allow extra pairs for when I forget my case and have to bin them before time), which costs me about **15 dollars** annually.

"I'm sure this doesn't apply to every skilled hobbyist out there, but speaking for myself, and a lot of artists I've seen try to build successful businesses from their art, I can say that there is a good chance that you will hate what you do as much, if not more than whatever you're doing now for employment. Especially if you have no experience in self-employment or know how to manage yourself with discipline and dedication.

I've been building gaming terrain for a living for close to a decade now, most of that time it's been my primary income source, and while I build everything with passion and perfection that I take pride in, it also *suuuuuuuuuuucks.* I often hate working on this stuff and only feel enjoyment when I'm done and don't have to look at it on the worktable any longer. Before it was a profession I had great enjoyment for the process, but now I just can't help but count the minutes that I'm wasting, the cost-to-time-pay ratios, and so on. The business aspect of it has taken over my life completely and contributed to a real degradation in my mental health, culminating in a major breakdown last year.

If you're going to turn your hobby into a business:

* Start it as a side job, don't get ahead of yourself. Start slow and small.
* Manage your time, learn to put only a certain amount of time into your work per day, per week. 
* Never start getting in the habit of taking on more work than you can handle in those hours. Be strict about this.
* Avoid ""Commission Hell"" where you get backed up working on custom projects for people and at the same time have to do other work to keep the lights on.
* Charge appropriately. Don't sell too cheap because you're desperate to be seen. Don't charge more than your quality is worth. See what comparable work is being sold for and judge yourself critically.
* Cramming will destroy your soul. If you get in the habit of working past your scheduled hours into the wee hours of the morning to meet a deadline, you WILL burn out very quickly. If you're doing this, you don't have a good work ethic, you've made a mistake in your judgement of what you can accomplish.
* Motivation is a lie, a passing mood, if you wait for motivation to get work done, it will never get done. You need *discipline.* If you have a hard time with this regularly, you need to learn how to push yourself *before* you go into business for yourself.

Enjoy your hobbies as hobbies and only think of changing this dynamic if you are absolutely sure and driven to take it to another level. Keep your working life and your resting/recreation time separate, or you may end up regretting it.","LPT: If you're thinking about turning your hobby into a profession, be aware that it will no longer feel like a hobby in short order, and may not have anywhere close to the same enjoyment.",self.LifeProTips,1549592882,761,LifeProTips,True,2019-02-07

"I am by no means a nutritionist but one of the easiest and first steps a person can take when trying to lose weight is to change what they drink. Drinks like soda, sweet tea, beer, and Gatorade are packed with calories and sugar that you most likely don't need! 

Even if you can't find the willpower to resist those hunger cravings you can definitely muster up the courage to drink water with that whole pizza. Small changes like this provide a great starting point without feeling overwhelmed and getting burnt out. 

I have spent most of my 27 years of life in the southeast region of the US so I can sympathize completely with those of you who believe sweet tea is a way of life but it doesn't have to be! It probably won't come immediately but if you make yourself drink plain (""unsweet"") tea you can come to appreciate the taste and flavor of tea instead of just the brown Kool aid that sweet tea is. There are many different options for flavored tea out there that are low calorie and have no sugar. 

Last, get away from that beer! Light or not, it's calories that can be avoided. I'm not a fan of hard liquor whether it's straight or in a mixed drink (which is usually more calories and sugar) so it was tough for me to find something to replace it. I eventually settled on red wine, Cabernet Sauvignon in particular. Like everything else, it'll probably take a few times before you can come to enjoy the taste but you probably didn't like beer the first time you tried it either.","LPT: Trying to lose weight or just be healthier overall?

We used to sit around puzzle board she had a know reguarly complete puzzles together. 

I remembered how much fun it was and the oddly satisfying feeling as you found matching pieces as parts of the puzzle came together. I went to see my mum the next day to tell her and we talked about it smiling at the memories. It even prompted her to go dig out a puzzle to start while I was there.

It took longer than I remembered and I completed it over a few nights. I'd had quite a few stressful days at work too and just coming home to the puzzle was a great way for me destress and relax.

At first my family thought I'd had some sort of midlife crisis as picked up a few cheap puzzles on offer in the days after.

However the nice thing was as the puzzle started to come together my wife, daughter and younger son all got more interested in it wanted to help to complete it too.

This weekend we are starting another together as a family.

"Everclear, as much as many of us hate it due to poor decision-making when drinking, is actually very useful in the home. Not for drinking though, fuck that noise. 

Cleaning: Everclear is 95% alcohol, so it will clean anything it touches, and it does so without leaving traces the same way bleach does. Laundry, dishes, wood, carpet, etc. Everclear can be used in so many ways, and it's a good thing to have in your pantry. Next time you're using ammonia to clean, try everclear and spare your nostrils. It's good for cleaning guns, and you could likely run your car on it in a pinch. It cleans guitar strings well, and is a good non-scented spray for furniture. 

The stuff works wonders, as long as you're not drinking it. $29 for a giant bottle is a good deal, and if you dilute it you can stretch it for quite a while.

"*""how you spend your morning can often tell you what kind of day you are going to have""*

&amp;#x200B;

The subject of morning routines is a popular one in the self-help world. Most see a stringent morning routine as something to strive for. But I'm here to tell you that's *not always the case.* In fact, your morning routine may actually be **hurting** your productivity.

# The Limitations of Morning Routines

A Lack of Flexibility, High Stakes, Impracticality.

Let me preface this by saying that, at the end of the day, it comes down to personal preference. You *can* have a beneficial morning routine. But, in my experience, they often hurt more than they help.

&amp;#x200B;

# A Lack of Flexibility

Morning routines are designed to be done *specifically* in the morning, which means that they are inherently not well-suited for randomness (and I think we can all agree that life is sometimes *very*random and unpredictable.)

So what happens when you have something more important to do in the morning? Generally, you skip your morning routine and get on with your day. But this can have big consequences...

# High Stakes

A lot is riding on your morning routine. The success or failure of your routine can mentally dictate the success or failure of your entire day. Obviously this is nice when you complete your routine, but when you don't it can quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. It can be very hard to recover, in terms of productivity, when you're inclined to call your day a failure by 9am (and this is not at all hyperbolic, I've seen it happen to many people.)

# Impracticality

Furthermore, it's quite impractical to expect yourself to do anything *every single day* (which is generally how morning routines are designed to be done.) Just think about how easy it is for you to floss your teeth every day. Yet, how many days did you miss last year? How many days have you already missed this year?

Once again, this means that morning routines can lead you down the rabbit hole of negative self-fulfilling prophecies. 

# Reversal

Morning routines can be useful for starting your day off on the right foot. So just do something small like a simple chore. Vacuuming or washing the dishes are great examples. But keep big, complex tasks out of it. Save those for daily or weekly routines.

# Overall

Morning routines are a slippery slope. They can be nice if you complete them, but can leave you feeling dejected and unmotivated if you don't. Their lack of flexibility and impracticality makes them an enemy of your productivity. That is, unless the routine is very simple.

# That's All

Again, it all comes down to preference. Personally, I prefer non-rigidity and the freedom to dictate my morning to whatever task I feel is most important in the moment. And I think it's more important for me to complete my goals *overall* than it is for me to complete them *specifically* in the morning.

But try different strategies and see what works for you! I hope this is clear enough and I hope that it was helpful. I know it seems rather simple and obvious, but for people stuck in the black hole of morning routines it can be a big paradigm shift! ","LPT: Keep ""high stakes"" out of your morning routine",self.LifeProTips,1549749328,8,LifeProTips,True,2019-02-09

"Veteran retail pharmacy worker here. Since it’s the start of the new year and there are lots of insurance changes etc, I figured I would share some tips that might help save you time and frustration. 

Spend about 15 minutes and give your insurance provider a call and ask about your deductible, co-pay etc. Having an idea of what your insurance will cover BEFORE you fill a prescription saves you the shock of finding out that your prescription is going to cost $200 due to your insurance co-pay while your at the cash register at the pharmacy. I’ve also seen insurance companies provide resources such as discounts to customers who cannot afford the full amount. 

Whatever pharmacy you go to is the “middle man” between you and your insurance. They do not set prices for your medicine or charge extra fees. It’s 100% your insurance. When you ask the employee “why is the prescription so much?” Or “I only paid $25 last month! Why is it $50 this month?” They aren’t going to know any more then you do. This can be frustrating to you as a customer because you want answers and the employee might not be much help. Understand that whatever price you pay is what your insurance is covering. 

Understand that the pharmacy you go to and your insurance company are two completely different entities and not one combined service. Knowing this can you save you the trouble of having to relying on pharmacy staff and spending your time waiting for answers. 

Many times pharmacy’s are grossly understaffed and deal with hundreds of different customers a day. Most pharmacy’s do not have the resources to call insurance companies on behalf of customers. It’s frustrating for you as a customer also when your in a hurry and have to wait around for the staff to get a hold of your insurance. We don’t have any special numbers that you don’t have access to ether. We just call the customer service line that’s on your insurance card. Taking an extra step and being proactive can really make your experience better.

"It may seem obvious or not important  but I recently deleted all my sad music from my phone and noticed a huge difference in how I handle a what I call “down time”. To a extent it’s okay to let your feelings out and songs that you relate to can help. But especially when you’re depressed and these terrible moods are coming every night, listening to these songs is no longer become a healthy outlet to let yourself feel these emotions, it’s just an enabler. I recommend some more mellow songs, I know super upbeat is just annoying to hear when you’re down.

"So, im a 17 year old girl and I live in Texas. I've always been a good kid, I was a cheerleader in high school (I graduated early last month), I was good at discus and other sports, I never smoked or drank ever really. I started dating a 20 year old when I was 16 and we stayed together for two years. He was really abusive and had spit on me, choked me, and hit me on several occasions. His mom and family even got physical with me. I never told anyone but close friends. It was a really toxic relationship. He lived with me at my moms house the entire time as well. I never left him because I couldn't see myself without him, but in June of 2018 I decided if I wanted to find myself again I'd have to leave him. I did, and at the time I had a job as a sous chef and finally saved up enough to get my own car. I got a 2009 chevy by myself at age of 16. So after I left him and had my own vehicle, I pretty much went wild. I never really had time to heal from the relationship because I started smoking weed, hanging out with friends, going to parties... I was lost. I smoked him off my mind, or hung out with people to fill the void. Eventually, I quit my great job as a sous chef (at the fanciest restaurant in my city btw) and got a new job as a Hostess somewhere else.

The job sucked and I could only work 2 days a week (not by choice) and I eventually quit and went to a different job I had worked previously. I fell 4 months behind on my car payment and have only paid 1/4 so far to catch up. (im just now becoming financially stable again.) Then, on Dec 18, I got arrested for POM. &lt;2 grams. I was in jail for a day and my car got towed resulting in more money being owed. I am just finishing paying that.

I've never had a good relationship with my mom and she is an alcoholic. My parents are divorced and I dont really see my dad.

Since I got arrested for weed, Im going to have probation. I haven't gone to court yet and probably won't for several months. **Im considering just sitting out time instead of probation and such.** Should I? I also have 3 tickets prior to the arrest. One for Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, Speeding, and MIP of a E-cig.

My mom is going to offer no financial support for me.

I also don't want to quit smoking. I've smoked at least once everyday since June and I like it. I don't see a problem with it other than the fact its illegal in my state. I function fine and its so normal to me.

I was 17 when I got arrested as well.

I've always been a good kid but it feels like im fucking up.

I also plan on going to ASU in TX in August. I was ready to start this month, in the spring semester, but I fucked around and tripped shrooms 4 AM the day of my SAT and had to skip it. I did reschedule it though. I want to major in Human Resources and work for people with disabilities.

"First yes, it can be used as roach killer. Stop whining. It is also used as antibiotic in storage liquid for contact lenses and in [female suppositories to fight bacterial infections](https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/boric-acid-for-yeast-infection).

If it is safe enough for internal vaginal use and use with contacts, it should be also safe to use topically on skin. I have not had any reaction on it and been using it with SO for years, so using it long term is not an issue.

You should not eat it, but you also don't eat baby powder, make up, hair spray, parfume etc... so this is kinda obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

You can buy it in bulk from chemical suppliers on eBay or similar. It can come as a fine grounded powder (try to get this) or as raw more granular powder similar to fine sand. It is water soluble but slowly, this is why you would want it in powder form. 

If you get the sand-type you will need to crush it into finer powder (I used coffee grinder), else it will simply fall off your skin (like sand) instead of sticking on skin to melt in contact with moisture.

&amp;#x200B;

To prove it works, try this for a day: take one teaspoon of boric acid powder and drop it into your worst smelly shoe (intentionally just one of the pair for now). Shake it well so it covers the insides and let the rest of boric acid stay on the bottom as you put it on (it melts). Use fresh socks with those smelly shoes and walk around normally whole day keeping them on all the time. Do NOT use any antiperspirant or deodorant on your feet as this would defeat the experiment.

  
When you compare the smell of your socks at the end of the day you will smell a huge diference between them. Deactivated bacteria can not produce any smell, the treated sneaker should smell each day even less as it airs out and should never start to smell back for at least a month of use or even longer, no matter how much you sweat and no matter if you do not use socks at all (worst way to cause huge smells).

Because of this I now actually have a problem comparing my (black) socks as I am not sure which ones are fresh and which ones were used multiple times if I mix them up. They all have absolutely zero smell.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus pro tip:  any stick, roll-on or moisturizing cream works as the perfect glue for boric acid, apply it as usually after shower, then rub powder on top of it.

Using this you will not be able to smell yourself no matter if you get drenched in sweat for a whole hot day. Same goes for shirt that was sweated through dripping wet, then air dried (without washing it). No smell at all (it can have salt stains from sweat and other types of dirt, but no body odor).",LPT: Boric acid is an antibiotic + bacteria in sweat produce BO = use boric acid as antiperspirant,self.LifeProTips,1547022437,1,LifeProTips,True,2019-01-09

Deactivated bacteria can not produce any smell, the treated shoe should smell less each day as it airs out and should never start to smell back for at least a month of use or even longer, no matter how much you sweat and no matter if you do not use socks at all.

Because of this I now actually have a problem selecting my (black) socks as I am not sure which ones are fresh and which ones were used multiple times if I mix them up. They all have absolutely zero smell and no visual difference in color.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus pro tip: any stick, roll-on or moisturizing cream works as the perfect glue for boric acid, apply it after shower as usual, then put a pinch (like salt) of boric acid powder on top of it and spread it around. I have not got a whiff of own armpit smell for years now... It is simply gone.

Using this nobody will be able to smell your BO no matter if you get drenched in sweat for a whole hot day. Same goes for the shirt that was sweated through (dripping wet from sweat), then air dried overnight (without washing it). No smell at all (it will have salt lines of sweat and maybe other types of dirt marks, but no body odor). ​ ​",LPT: Boric acid is an antibiotic + bacteria in sweat produce BO = remove BO with boric acid,self.LifeProTips,1547045326,5,LifeProTips,True,2019-01-09

"*This is especially important for anything related to your major(s).* You may need to reference old assignments, PDFs, or lecture slides for your job, or you may want to show potential employers examples of your skills/abilities/experience.    

Personally, I recommend using a personal storage device (e.g. flash drive or external hard drive) to store your files; however, services like Dropbox, Google Drive, and GitHub are fine, too - as long as the account is your own. The point is that you do not want to trust your school to maintain your work. Reasons for this are as follows:

1. Professors often remove old material from their websites to protect against illegal re-distribution of course content.
2. Schools periodically purge old course websites from their servers to make room for new ones.
3. For anything that is your own work, YOU have the rights to it, so YOU should always have your own copy. And if you wind up needing it at some point, you will be thankful that you saved it and know exactly where to find it.

For YEARS I've tried every variation I could find.  New eggs, old eggs, ice bath, no ice bath, steaming, boiling etc.  Nothing was consistent, every batch would be different but I never found a way to cook truly easy to peel eggs until I got an Instapot.

This is what I do:

Take the trivet that comes with the pot and put it in.  Then depending on the size of your instapot, make a single layer of eggs on the trivet.  I've never tried more than a single layer, so try that at your own risk.  On my instapot, i can fit about 16 normal sized eggs in a single layer.

Pour a cup of water in the bottom

On manual cooking, set it to high pressure, turn off the ""keep it warm"" button, set it for 5 minutes cook time.

When the timer goes off, set your own timer for 5 minutes.  This is for natural depressurization.  When that timer goes off, immediately depressurize the rest of the way manually by toggling the valve (BE CAREFUL, ITS STEAM)

Take the pot out and set it aside to let them cool naturally, no ice water bath or anything like that.

When they're cool enough to handle, crack one on the side...the shell should twist right off in two pieces.  If it doesn't happen that way, you cooked them too long or didn't depressurize fast enough.

"If you are on a camping trip or something and forgot a die you need for a game you can still manage with just a coin. You’ll just need to familiarize yourself with binary (which is fairly simple). 
In decimal each digit is multiplied by a power of ten, so 523 = 5*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 3*10^0 = 500 + 20 + 3. Binary is the same with a base of 2 instead. Below are the numbers 0-7:

000 = 0
001 = 1
010 = 2
011 = 3
100 = 4
101 = 5
110 = 6
111 = 7

So in the example of simulating a die you just need to flip the coin three times: each time record a 0 if heads, or a 1 of tails (or vice versa). Record the three digits and you’ll get a number between 0 and 7. If you get a 0 or a 7 just go again. To illustrate:

Flip 1: H. Record 0. 
0

Flip 2: T. Record 1. 
10

Flip 3: T. Record 1. 
110 = 6

You can actually use this to simulate (pretty much) any random number from any uniform distribution but it becomes really inefficient really fast.

"  

I'm having doubts about the career I chose. I'm 24 years old, and I'm studying electrical engineering at the moment , but I'm starting to dislike it (I find some subjects EXTREMELY BORING). Next year, I'm thinking about dropping out of college and start studying to go to medical school, which is the course that I really wanted, ( I know it sounds really dumb, but I took certain paths in life that led me far away from my goal )....

the problem is that :

\* I feel VERY old (if I stay on engineering , in about 3 years I will have a degree. If I try medical school, , I would finish college with 32-33)

\* I live with my grandparents, and I depend on them financially. I'm very afraid that if I change my course, they die when I’m in the middle of medical school. In that case, I would have to drop out, and find a ordinary job so I don’t starve to death.

Honestly i don’t know if I give up having a degree earlier to follow my childhood dream, or i continue engineering until I find a subject / area that i will enjoy studying, and maybe even working in the future ...

Its too late to achieve financial independence only after my 30’s? Throw away my final 20’s having no money, and pass my weekends studying in my bedroom while everyone is having a life outside, OR have a lifetime working on something so boring that i want to kill myself every day ? It’s too late to make a decision like this? 

This dilemma, has been killing me since the beginning of the year, when I tried to drop out of college and put my plan into practice, but I ended up giving up because i had FEAR. What should I do? I’m crying almost every week thinking that maybe I throwed away the best years of my life studying something that I think it was the best for me, for the wrong reasons (money, mainly).

PS: I do not live in the United States, so I don’t have to pay ONE CENT for my education , which makes my case less terrible I think because If I change my course i didn’t spent money at least, only life years … ",[LPT] Should I change from engineering to medicine?,self.LifeProTips,1544451299,1,LifeProTips,True,2018-12-10

If you're not using a resume building tool (like on Indeed) or are submitting a hard copy, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD don't walk in with some half-assed text wall and expect someone to decipher the information they need. Microsoft Word and most other word processors have templates available for this exact thing. USE THEM. Also, stay away from lots of colors. We don't care how pretty it looks, and it's distracting. 

2. **ORGANIZE** the information you provide on your resume, and make sure it's easy to read. When hiring, managers usually have to read dozens of resumes, and if you've got too much going on they'll just skim over it and move on. DO NOT OVERSHARE. If you have more than 4 jobs under your belt, try to limit the ones you list to those that are applicable to the field or position you're applying to. 

3. **HAVE MULTIPLE RESUMES.** This goes back to the previous point (and title) - if you've got a lot of experience in a bunch of different fields, it makes more sense to have two or three resumes geared towards specific skill sets than to have one gigantic resume listing everything you've ever done. It's harder for a hiring manager to hone in on what they're looking for if they've got your whole life story to sort through.

4. **PAY SOMEONE IF YOU HAVE TO.** If you can afford it, pay someone to write up and format your resume(s). It's a good investment, and once you've got the template it's easy to edit your information as needed. It seems like a no-brainer, but surprisingly few people think about this.

this feature also comes with a sizable delay before the window actually focuses, and will automatically raise the window you hover over to the top, both of which can be fixed easily through regedit.

&amp;#x200B;

for fixing the raise: open regedit.exe &gt;  *HKEY Current User -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Desktop -&gt; UserPreferencesMask* and then use Windows’ calculator in programmer/hex mode (choose View -&gt; Programmer in the menu, then select *Hex* on the left) to subtract 40 from the value of the first byte of the string of the registry value.   


fixing the delay is even easier:  edit the value of the *ActiveWndTrkTimeout* key which is in the same *Desktop* registry branch as the above key and change the value to something like 100 (decimal) which will decrease the focus delay a bit.

"This might seem obvious to some of you but I constantly see posts on Facebook asking for shop recommendations, and there’s always a comment that says something along the lines of “cheap prices and good work.” This is almost never the case. We are a very specialized group of people and our job takes a lot of time to get good at, sometimes a decade or more at 60-80 hours a week, most of that unpaid. The amount of prep that goes into a fantastic tattoo can be borderline ridiculous and the prices usually reflect that. 

You also have to take into consideration that a lot of us are paying 30% to sometimes 60% of what you’re paying us to the shop and on top of that we still have to pay into taxes at the end of the year and also buy our own supplies (depending on where you are) which is also expensive. A good artist is not going to buy cheap supplies and trust me there is a difference in quality when it comes to machines, needles and ink. This all compounds and is part of what makes good tattoos expensive. 

A tattoo is not a piece of furniture that you can afford to cheap out on; it cannot he resold or returned and it is a lifetime investment. The hundreds to sometimes tens of thousands of dollars you pay for it should be looked at like a lifetime investment which will last you upwards of 80 years if you’re lucky. Heavily research your artist and ALWAYS try to see their healed work in photos that aren’t heavily edited if you can.

"1. Clean the shoes and slippers from inside properly. Roll small items like socks, tshirts, ties, jewellery etc and keep them inside the shoes and slippers.

2. Carry plastic boxes or small cartons and keep them inside it and then put the box in the luggage. You might think it is time taking, tedious or unnecessary but this has helped me to a great extent in making room for other stuff and keep things secure.

3. Always roll the clothing items instead of folding them. It will make you an extra space and you keep more items.

4.  Seen the inside of curved edges in a suitcase? Make small pouches and attach them with a tape in that area. It helps adding anything last minute. 

5. Line all bags with a bubble-wrap to keep everything safe inside. You can also cover everything with single bubble wrap sheet. It will clear your head-space for any anxieties that you may have while stressing over anything breakable in your luggage.

6. Don’t throw small bottles or tubs. Wash them and keep them safe. Fill them with your favourite products. Label them and voila! You will save money and time, only to enjoy your favourite products on the go.

 7. Always carry an iron so you don’t have to worry about the creased clothes, cold weather and sheets. (I have this habit of ironing clothes before I wear them in a colder weather. It feels cosy and nice when I am travelling. Win-Win)

8. It should be number 1. Start packing your bag/suitcase with the things you think you want to take for your trip. Sounds unnecessary but i has always given me a reason to be happy all the time thinking of the travel and it keeps my mind active in terms of thinking what to take and what not.  It also saves me time and headache of last minute packing.

"Not sure if this belongs here but I'll post it anyway since it benefited me a lot.

I'm sure many of you will relate; I used to impulsively check my phone as soon as I received a notification from a social media such as Snapchat or Instagram. It also got to the point where if I didn't receive a certain amount of pings or my phone was empty, it would get me down so that these stupid little red circles were controlling my mood. 

The problem lies within the concept that there is a dopamine release association and a lack of notifications means a lack of a fix. 

To work around this I disabled all notifications for social media meaning I now check my phone less and don't care when my lock screen is empty because that's how I expect it to be. An added bonus is when you do eventually open the apps, you get a surprise from all the messages you may have unknowingly received.

"This tip will probably bring you no direct and measurable benefits, but it will contribute a great deal to humanity, of which you are a part of.

&amp;#x200B;

""Wishful Thinking"" is believing something is true because you want it to be true. But that goes far beyond the obvious and the harmless. People use a series of debatable arguments to support a faulty theory, simply because they want it to be true, even though they don't recognize that desire, and don't even realize they are under that kind of influence. It's vital for all people, in all situations, to ponder if they are not being led to some specific opinion because they want it to be true.

And there are several reasons for wanting something to be true, it doesn't happen only when you have some direct benefit from the outcome. Sometimes it's only to prove you were right, or to prove that the group you support is correct, or better. In fact, if you have almost all opinions coinciding with a large group of people, it's a sign of a loss of identity and loss of critical sense - besides having connection with another type of fallacy ""Argumentum ad populum"".

&amp;#x200B;

I think logical fallacies should be an obligatory class in high school, because when letting yourself be deceived by fallacies, society loses, even through well-intentioned individuals.

I used to think empathy was the most important characteristic that needed to be worked out by humanity, but now I think understanding fallacies for a situation analysis and to elaborate arguments is even more primordial.","LPT: Consider ""Wishful Thinking"" Fallacy",self.LifeProTips,1542027844,3,LifeProTips,True,2018-11-12

"Most of you only use Google Maps, while travelling because most of the time it is completely sufficient. But in other countries other map apps with different sources can be better. For example appes based on OpenStreetMap, something like Wikipedia for maps, where anyone can add information to. (Hint: You can join too)

**Available informations from map**

Not always everything is mapped up to the finest detail in Google Maps. In foreign countries the situation may differ but also in the North America or Europe hiking paths and forest roads are often missing. 

[For example in Dar es Salaam](https://imgur.com/a/4QtGQXT) the biggest city of Tanzania Google Maps lacks basic information but an OpenStreetMap based app like Maps.me has significantly more information.
[Same thing here](https://imgur.com/nzf3Gww) for the Kithal Ella Falls in Sri Lanka. 

**Data consumption**

Offline maps can be worth gold if one has no access to the internet in a foreign country. Google Maps often does not allow to download bigger parts of an area. OpenStreetMap apps like [Maps.me](https://maps.me/) or [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/features) are able to download entire countries including walking paths, shop data, opening hours, etc. 

**Offline Wikipedia articles**

Another point I really loved, when travelling lately is the connection between OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia. You see a church and want to find a bit more about it? OsmAnd for example is able to show you [all Wikipedia articles near an object](https://i.imgur.com/b5WLquq.png) on the map. Around the Marienkirche here in Berlin for example are ten objects that are described in Wikipedia, like the church itself or the famous Berlin television tower. All the wikipedia articles of your destination can also be stored offline, which makes it even better. 


**Navigation**

Google Maps is great for car navigation with the real time traffic data. But as a pedestrian you need information about stairs and small paths. Other navigation/map apps may have them. In my hometown Google[ suggests walking 25 min](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/51.0631217,13.7973589/51.0642588,13.7979464/@51.0649749,13.7922223,17z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e2) to get from the River footway to the castle.[ In reality](https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=graphhopper_foot&amp;route=51.06315%2C13.79690%3B51.06426%2C13.79785#map=19/51.06366/13.79737) it is just a 5min walk going up some stairs.

"Disclaimer: Long.   
This is an LPT that some people might argue doesn't require writing. And it shouldn't. But since I joined a very well known company about a year ago, I've had a surprising number of old colleagues or distant friends asking me to get them a job. For the record, I've helped 2 such colleagues so far, who I supported (even though I didn't get to refer them) by coaching them on how to interview, what content to study up on, etc. I'm genuinely driven to find the best talent for my company (I'm not in recruiting). To their credit, both secured and accepted job offers.   
This LPT is for the other 90% who want to feel the thrill of seeing a job offer from prestigious X company, but have no idea how to start. (**Hint**: asking your cousin's friend's husband who is employed there to hook it up is not the way in).   
It doesn't matter what role you want to apply for. The last person who approached me is currently an engineering manager, with 15 years of industry experience. Some people think that if they worked with you 8 years ago for 3 months on a side project and you were on friendly terms, that's all they need to get their foot in the door. Its a really optimistic way to view the world! But sadly, that's not generally how it works. These tips could also apply if your heart's desire is to be a pancake house waitress.   
Also, if you are currently such a person, it doesn't mean you would suck at your job or automatically should be disqualified from ever being hired to that company. You could be an absolute rock star, but just not know the path to showing your goods to the right people.

With that, I want to offer these 3 points on how to leverage a connection (even a distant one) for a job opportunity:  


**1. You are your best advocate.**   
DON'T: Approaching me with no description of what you want to do, or what you're good at, with simply a job title that you currently hold, tells me that you see yourself as an easily replaceable resource. You're automatically not valuable, because you're haven't given your past work enough credit. Why would I want to help you, and risk looking like a fool in front of my peers or recruiters for recommending a non-valuable candidate?   
DO: Before you reach out to me, make sure your resume is ready to be sent. The act of updating your resume brings up fresh memories of all the stories you can tell that highlights what you're truly great at - whether it's driving a team of 500 people to land a wonderful new product, or a speed-record in dishwashing.   
Rather than asking me to connect you to any job that has a certain job title or falls under a certain umbrella term like ""accounting"", check that company's website for open roles.   
If you find the exact role you would like to apply for and your resume is ready, go ahead and reach out! If you find a role similar to what you want to do, your resume is ready, you can still reach out (but don't expect the other person to pull away from their work to job hunt for you). Some companies will accept general applications, and have recruiters that will reach out if a job comes up that's the right match for you.    
TL;DR: Narrow the scope of the conversation before it even begins, so that your connection feels like they can take immediate action (e.g. submit an internal referral, or at least think about if there are any good roles that match what you do). It's a good idea to include your resume with your very first message. 

**2. Following up is A-okay, within reason.**

DON'T: Message your connection through 3 different messaging services, obsessively check if they've seen your message about wanting a job at their company, or grill them if they've seen your message but haven't responded. Your connection is probably busy with their own lives - if you felt comfortable enough to message them, assume that they will want to help you. Give them some time.  
DO: If your connection gives no response for a month and you're getting antsy, there are lots of things you can do.   
a. Remember that they have no responsibility to do you a favor. Unless you've saved them from a burning collapsing building before... even still.  
b. Take a look again at what you've sent them. Was the scope narrow enough that a small effort on their part could mean taking you to the next step? If not, go back to step 1.   
c. If you feel that you've done step 1 wonderfully but are still getting no response, it's okay to nudge. Message again, don't sound irritated, and ask nicely if they might be able to help. Also, give them an out! Something like ""you might be really busy, so if this isn't the right time to ask for your support, I completely understand! If I don't hear from you for another 2 weeks, I will move on"".   
d. Don't follow up more frequently than is reasonable. I'd say no more than once a month. Remember point a.   
TL;DR: Your connection probably doesn't owe you anything, so you must drive the conversation by following up. But don't guilt-trip or drive them insane.   
**3. If your connection does lend their support, be prompt and courteous with all your responses. And make your schedule available for them!**

I think this one speaks for itself, so I'll save the words.

"I have been smoking for 10 years, nearly one pack a day on average. As I have turned 30, I realized I cannot keep this up. I need to go stop. But the experience has been very hard, as we all know it. I tried stopping cold turkey, I tried gum, I tried patches. Nothing really worked.

Until my friend gave me a taste of e-cigarette at a house poker game. I tried it once and realize it felt really close to smoking. So I thought, I might as well try it out since nothing has worked so far. I was very surprised I can replace smoking cigarette with this e-cigarette, I didn’t even crave for it. 

One day, when others are smoking cigarette around me, I felt disgusted, I hate that smell. That is the moment when I realize this e-cigarette worked! 

I know, most of you may say smoking e-cigarette is still smoking, but getting off e-cigarette is much easier than tobacco cigarette, trust me. You can gradually decrease your nicotine intake and most importantly, in the process transition to e-cigarette, your loves are already benefiting from not having to suffer from 2nd hand smoke. 

I would highly recommend those to try it out if they have exhausted their options.

"I have had a rollercoaster of a life. I was born in Chicago Illinois to my mother, who at the time was 15, and my father 17. In my family it was often an inside joke that I was the product of a teenage experiment. In fact, I almost didn't exist at all, but my grandmother convinced my mother not to have an abortion.

Fast forward a bit, my mother and father split, but sheertsy stepdad and they both to college with me in tow. That is one thing I am very thankful for from my past. I literally grew up in a household during the most intellectually stimulating part of their lives. As a result, though we didn't have much money, my siblings and I were as sharp as it gets.

Fast forward a bit, my mother and father split, but sheertsy stepdad and they both to college with me in tow. That is one thing I am very thankful for from my past. I literally grew up in a household during the most intellectually stimulating part of their lives. As a result, though we didn't have much money, my siblings and I were as sharp as it gets.

Eventually though my mother got addicted to hard drugs and got a divorce from my step father. This marked the beginning of the end for me. I started to do very poorly in school, we moved to a very seedy trailer park surrounded by criminals and drug addicts.

I wasn't doing well either. I all but gave up my schooling to the point that my parents Sent me to a government ran vocational school called Job Core. There it was part school, part military, part prison.

Many of the people there were troubled kids like myself. I did not complete the program because in the middle of it I got a call that would change my life yet again. My best friend that I literally knew since birth (we were inseparable) had died.

That was it. No warning, no build up, she was just gone, hit by a drunk driver. I didn't even get a call until she was already gone.

When I came back, losing my best friend like that made me numb for a long time. I went to community college, got enough transfer credits and then attended a University. There I started to feel and do better. But I still had a lot of pain that I escaped by drinking.

Eventually I drank more than studied and dropped out of college. It was at this point I did not want to live anymore. I was living at my grandmother's house, an alcoholic and college dropout. I didn't even have a job.

I figured death was the only option for me, but it was in the depths of that sadness that my perspective started to shift. It all started when I met a girl online.

She was struggling like was, she had lime disease and was frail, but fiesty, very smart, and beautiful. She was the first ray of hope that came into my life that made me feel like life was worth living.

Unfortunately, she lived in New York and I lived in Illinois. So eventually, me having no way to get to her and vice versa, we stopped talking.

At the same time my mother bought a house in Florida  and I was moving with her as long as I helped her renovate. Keep in mind I still had no car or job.

I felt helpless, but when I stopped talking to my New York fling something changed in me. I was fed up with my own excuses to myself. I was going to either get busy living, or get busy dying.

So my mother's boyfriend got me a construction job. It wasn't what I wanted but at least I could make some money. What I really wanted to do was write, but everyone in my family said that was nuts and would never make any money. I had never given up though. The whole time I was reading or writing something, usually both.

It is amazing how much a perspective shift can change your life. I decided I just was going to do whatever it took to make my life something I wanted. That was the most productive three months of my life. I bought a car (a junker), worked a full time job, and wrote a YA fantasy novel all while helping my mother renovate her house. I also started exercising regularly and eating better. I even quit smoking and drinking. 

Life is beautiful because the moment you let it know that you want to start trying and appreciate your life, it starts to help you out. Because it was only shortly after this I met Megan, my current wife and love of my life.

She showed me the kind of unconditional love I didn't think even existed. She loved me when I couldn't love myself. And that was when I learned an important lesson in life, that love really is all you need.

When I stopped focusing on what I didn't have and started being grateful for what I did, it completely changed my world. From there I started writing online. I decided I would find a way to get paid for writing matter what.

So I started ghostwriting stories online for a penny a word. It was practically nothing, but I was doing it. I was making money doing what I loved.

It wasn't long until a company reached out to me and took me on their SEO team. Suddenly I was making about 50,000 a year working about 3 days a week from home with a great girlfriend and a nice rental. It was more luxury than I had ever experienced before. We even had an inflatible hot tub.
 
It wasn't all rainbows though. My
Now wife (then girlfriend) was miserable at her job, and I was eating and drinking myself to an early grave. My girlfriend got so unhappy there I felt like nothing I did helped. I even got her a job working for my company because she liked the idea of working from home. She hated that job too and it wasn't long before we had a big fight and broke up.

We spent some time apart and really I was relieved to be free from the drama. Eventually though we started to miss each other, and we got back together. From there we decided to be a team in everything that we did. 

We realized we were both at fault for our relationship not working. I spent a lot of time ignoring her, focused on building my seo marketing business, which was really taking off. But I had originally made the company with the intent of having to do less work, and ended up burying myself in it instead. I was miserable from always working and she resented me for ignoring her.

So when we got back together, I quit the business and we ended up getting married, going on a cruise, and buying a home. My wedding was the happiest day of my life. Today my wife and I work 20 hours a week a piece and are happier than we have ever been.

It was only recently that I looked back at my life and realized that the way I felt, whether happy or sad, dictated how events unfolded in my life. The more grateful I was, the more content, the better my life. I also learned that my whole life I had been healing from traumas that I had to undergo in order to gain insight and wisdom.

I realized that money doesn't buy happiness, that so many are chasing down inthis idea of happiness, when having it is as simple as flipping a switch.

I kept trying to fill this void in myself that was making me so unhappy and I realized I was making the void. So when I closed the void, all of a sudden everything in my life was enough, great even. I was free.

It was then I knew what I had to do. I had to use the wisdom and insights that were so hard won from my horrible past experiences and help so many others who are broken too. Who are chasing things they don't want by doing things they hate to do, just like I was.

I realized the happier and more genuine I was, the better my life became. How I treated people determined how they treated me  So now I share this life transforming wisdom with others through my website and my YouTube channel (link are in my bio).

"I work in IT, in multiple contracts, with a laptop I take between work sites and home. Time management and ensuring I have clear off-the-clock hours was the origin of this practice.

Having two user accounts is not that hard to set up and get in the habit of switching between them.

"For those who agree : https://old.reddit.com/r/LGBTotallyWrong/

LGBT Are totally wrong both scientifically and religiously, where :

1. Science proves that LGTB can't have any offspring which will mean that a community full of LGBT will eventually extinct within 100 years, about the LGBT who said adoption as a solution are only mean they admit they are wrong.

2. There is no religion who allow LGBT, LGBT are grave sin and are damned.

LGBT Must stop speaking nonsense about their human rights because they themselves exist by violating other's human rights, without us normal humans then they will not even be alive to this day because they themselves can't have any offspring. No one who is born as LGBT because if that is true then there will be no human and other living beings in the world since millions years ago to this day, this mean that those who are LGBT is because of their own choice but their choice is totally the wrong choice.

"So I know this might sound obvious - to keep the promises you make to yourself - but in my past experience, the promises you make to yourself are the easiest ones to break. 

This is because when you break a promise to a friend/family member and break it, there's usually consequences. You'll feel fear of anger or disappointment from another person if you made a promise and break it, and this drives us to do our best to keep promises we make to others. 

When it comes to a promise you make to yourself - eliminating a bad habit, making a positive life change, thinking or acting differently - there's no one else holding you accountable. Only yourself. And that's why you need to hold yourself accountable. 

You need to be able to trust yourself. If you have trouble with this, start with small things. Things you can easily accomplish to show you can do it. And make a point to only make promises to yourself that you fully intend to keep.  Don't do it excessively or flippantly. If you do keep them, reward yourself. It's one of the best ways you can make progress and grow as a person. If you're not able to do it, it shows a great lack of maturity and integrity.

"If This Then That (IFTTT) is an online app that connects two different services. It's really useful for glueing things together to automate your life. For this LifeProTip, I use it to make expense tracking a lot easier for myself.

In IFTTT, create a new applet. Choose *Google Assistant* as the **THIS** and choose ""*Say a phrase with both a number and a text ingredient*"" as the trigger.  For **THAT**, choose *Google Sheets* and choose ""*Add row to spreadsheet*"" as the action.

The phrase that I used was ""*Add # expense for $*"" and this seems to work well. I initially tried ""Add # to my expense tracker for $"", but it confused the ""to"" for a ""2"" so it didn't work correctly.  Essentially, avoid the words ""to"" or ""for"" near the number and you'll be fine.

Another note, you'll need to say ""Thirteen dollars and fifty cents"" instead of ""Thirteen fifty"" or it'll enter 1350 instead of 13.50 in your tracker.

**Bonus LifeProTip:** You can trigger reminders based on calendar events! For **THIS**, use the *Google Calendar* and use the ""*New event from search*"" as the trigger. For the keyword or phrase I added ""*#Budget*"".  For **THAT**, choose ""*Send me and SMS*"" and put your ""*Ok Google, Add # expense for $*"" phrase in.

"If This Then That (IFTTT) is an online app that connects two different services. It's really useful for glueing things together to automate your life. For this LifeProTip, I use it to make expense tracking a lot easier for myself.

In IFTTT, create a new applet. Choose *Google Assistant* as the **THIS** and choose ""*Say a phrase with both a number and a text ingredient*"" as the trigger. For **THAT**, choose *Google Sheets* and choose ""*Add row to spreadsheet*"" as the action.

The phrase that I used was ""*Add # expense for $*"" and this seems to work well. I initially tried ""Add # to my expense tracker for $"", but it confused the ""to"" for a ""2"" so it didn't work correctly. Essentially, avoid the words ""to"" or ""for"" near the number and you'll be fine.

Another note, you'll need to say ""Thirteen dollars and fifty cents"" instead of ""Thirteen fifty"" or it'll enter 1350 instead of 13.50 in your tracker.

**Bonus LifeProTip:** You can trigger reminders based on calendar events! For **THIS**, use the *Google Calendar* and use the ""*New event from search*"" as the trigger. For the keyword or phrase I added ""*#Budget*"". For **THAT**, choose ""*Send me and SMS*"" and put your ""*Ok Google, Add # expense for $*"" phrase in. Now whenever you have a calendar event with the #Budget tag in the title or description it'll send you a text to remind you to add the expense.","LPT: Make expense tracking so much easier.

I admire how much effort you put in protecting everyone (Mother, Father, siblings, extended family, and friends) and yourself.  It takes energy to appease so many people.  It takes energy when you are unable to appease them as well.  I believe you are able to see and hear opinions, a massive waterfall of input - to the point of being too much.

You are the creator, distributor, and supreme leader of your energy.  As you achieve in your life, realize how much power you have.  

It’s easy to get lost in the environment.  It’s social norm to flex and allow intrusion to your life.  Regardless of anything that is happening to you - believe in your energy, capability, and know you’ll find the best for you.

Clear your mind.  Breathe strongly.  Let your emotions teach you - then access the deeper energy to act as necessary to achieve your goals, so those same emotions never hurt you.

"Many of us don't get as much sleep as we should. To offset this, we often hit snooze when the alarm goes off. The problem is, snoozing for those extra 5, 10, or 15 minutes does us no good.

Want to break the snoozing habit (and the mid-day slump you feel)? Start by setting a bed time. I know, it sounds cheesy as shit, but if you *really* want to feel well rested and recharged for your day, you're going to have to start giving a shit about how much sleep you get.

Set your ""bed time"" and be prepared to be in bed at that time. Start preparing for sleep 15-20 minutes beforehand, depending on your nightly rituals.

When your alarm goes off in the morning, get out of the bed and start your day. Repeat the process the next night and the following morning (no snooze!). Your body will adjust sooner than you think. For me, it was no more than a week.

I'll be honest with you, it's not easy initially. The temptation is there. Resist!

Eventually, your sleep pattern will be established and you'll begin feeling drowsy/sleepy at a more reasonable time in the evenings and you'll wake a little easier in the mornings -and you won't even be tempted to his snooze.

"Hi everyone,

I currently live just outside of Washington, DC in Arlington, VA, but am likely going to move into DC come January. Looking for places in the winter is definitely an advantage because demand is lower, but obviously supply is lower too. With this being said -- what are some LPT to find a good deal on an apartment in a major city? 

&amp;#x200B;

The answer might be simply ""you can't,"" but what are some steps you can do to snag a deal before anyone else? I knew a guy who a year or so ago got a huge apartment with a balcony for what I am paying now ($1500 w/utilities) because he physically went from apartment to apartment in a specific area, asking for deals and such.

"Budget laptops simply aren't designed to last for up to 4 years under heavy use. In fact, the 2 most common hardware problems i've seen with laptops are with budget laptops:

1) a broken screen, because someone was careless or purposefully destructive. Trust me when I say these are usually extremely easy to replace. And yes, youtube tutorials are occasionally made by jackwads who don't realize that the repair they're demonstrating is much easier than they think it is, so they make the repair more difficult for themselves.

2) the hinges start to fall apart. THIS, however, is always a huge pain in the ass.

In fact, with few exceptions, most budget laptops will be made of plastic, and will have hinge issues if it lasts long enough. Do you see any problems that manifest themselves when you open or close the laptop? that's most likely a hinge problem.

Technically, the hinges themselves are usually just fine. They're almost always made of metal, and they're pretty durable. However, the hinges are mounted to both the screen's lid as well as the bottom case. What are they mounted to? Cheap fucking plastic. Sure, if you're careful, you might be able to get a good few years out of that budget $500 laptop, but the act of opening and closing that laptop thousands of times places wear and tear on the plastic those hinges are mounted to. Over time, the screw holes wear down, the plastic cracks, and if you let it get bad enough, your screen might be damaged, too.

If you get hinge problems it may or may not require you to replace the entire fucking case, and that means disassembling the entire computer. If you want to avoid hinge problems, I highly suggest getting a laptop with a metal case. That variety tends to be a more expensive, premium model. They have better features, for sure, but they also tend to last longer, too.

tl;dr: if you need a laptop to last for 4 years under heavy use, you can't afford to buy a cheap laptop.","LPT: When buying a laptop computer for college, be very wary about purchasing a budget laptop. it's most likely not going to last under 4 years of heavy use.",self.LifeProTips,1539372102,6,LifeProTips,True,2018-10-12

"Because you assume people know how you feel about them, or you're only talking about it for the first time during an argument, or in a eulogy.

Earlier this week, on Tuesday, my girlfriend and I were hanging out. She  casually left, and neither of us barely acknowledged her leaving. She called me less than 5 minutes later, because she had gotten into a car accident and was scared. 

When she  called me the phone cut out and I panicked. She called me back, and luckily she was ok. It made me think how fragile each moment really is, and you can't wait for a bday, or vday, or anniversary to grab your woman, look her in the eyes, and let her know that her face is all you're thinking about when you're racing home after work, and that you still love her smell and touch, and taste too.

Today, I came home to see that she had moved out and left a goodbye letter. I'm not a perfect man,  so maybe I didn't deserve her. But you wonder why so many things are left unsaid, until after it's too late.

"More to the LPT: we all have felt that tightening in the backs of our skull when we are exerting massive amounts of energy trying to be polite to someone even though we feel uncomfortable. We also know what it feels like to just be yourself, when you are around close friends or family.

No one wants to be around someone that takes up all our energy. We want to be around someone that puts us at ease. Among many, many other things, stress in relationships come from not understanding each other; our motives and purpose are not aligned. But when we empathize with someone by simply trying to be considerate of their feelings and whatever they are going through, we share in their struggles and connect with that person. When we share in someone's struggles, we become considerate and understanding of their situation. Not everyone, but many people, will come to appreciate you and will want to have you around because you make their life easier, not harder.

The last thing I want to add is that it's important to be genuine. Don't try to fake being considerate because someone going through something serious can tell who relates to them and who is just being ""nice.""

"The word lieutenant derives from French; the lieu meaning ""place"" as in a position (in lieu of); and tenant meaning ""holding"" as in ""holding a position""; thus a ""lieutenant"" is a placeholder for a superior, during their absence.

In the 19th century, British writers who considered this word either an imposition on the English language, or difficult for common soldiers and sailors, argued for it to be replaced by the calque ""steadholder"". However, their efforts failed, and the French word is still used, along with its many variations (e.g. lieutenant colonel, lieutenant general, lieutenant commander, flight lieutenant, second lieutenant and many non-English language examples), in both the Old and the New World.

"The only reason inkjet printers still exist is to drain consumer's wallets.  The people who make the hardware and the ink make a killing off of them because people use way more ink than actually ends up being printed on paper and hardware needs to be replaced often due to inherent flaws with liquid ink printing.

Most people know that printer ink already costs more than gold by weight.  It also dries out easily.  If it dries inside the printer head, the dried ink damages the printer and the whole machine usually has to be replaced.  Printers compensate for this fundamental problem by occasionally spraying ink thru the nozzles even when it's not used, which wastes ink.  Some folks unplug the printer to stop this, but it is even worse if ink dries and clogs the nozzles.

Meanwhile, laser and even color laser printers cost about the same price these days for the hardware.  Laser prints are cleaner and crisper.  They don't smudge.    Toner costs a little more on the front end but it lasts marathons.  Toner also lasts for an estimated number of pages and actually keeps true to it since toner does not dry out over time, even after years, which makes laser the best option for people who print infrequently.  This means no more replacing printers that don't work due to clogged heads and throwing out half-full ink cartridges that won't work.

On the subject of color printers in general:  monochrome is still the cheapest and best option for most people.  For those considering a color printer, ask yourself how many times you need to print in color over the course of a year.  Remember that the best looking photos are printed professionally, like from Mpix or shutterfly or even many pharmacies and grocery stores -- they also cost less than the maintenance of a color printer unless you do it all the time.

By doing this you'll greatly improve your odds of not getting decalcifications (level 1 karies) and cavities (level 2 and 3 karies). Cavities are expensive to repair. If you have open cavities you can't for instance whiten your teeth. If you try, you risk killing the tooth with the cavity.

Remember decalcifications can still be repaired by itself as long as you keep really good mouth hygiene.

"Hey everyone, not a long time ago, I posted about how to stop autoplay videos on chrome (go to chrome://flags and change autoplay policy to document user activation) and firefox (go to about:config and change media.autoplay.enabled to 'false'), but some people were still getting videos that auto-launched on sites like CNN, ESPN, CNET etc.  

so, I wanted to share this information with everyone.

I know that not everyone wants to install extensions, and this is not a tutorial on how to do that.  BUT, I know that at least 'privacy badger' is from the EFF (electronics frontier foundation), an organization that is built on defending internet privacy, so I trust it.  

Once you have the extension installed, just visit a site that has the offensive autolaunching video that occurs despite you having autoplay disabled.  click on the extension icon, and a list of 'cookies' will pop up.  Just go through the list and start disabling cookings, one by one, and relaunch the page, until you have disabled the offensive cookie.  And, this way, you can also automatically disable cookies that will track info that goes back into facebook, twitter, etc, as well.  Brightcove is one of the video players that will automatically launch, so you can rely on shutting that off will reduce the number of automatically launching videos.

BEWARE:  sometimes if you just ham handedly shut off all the cookies, sometimes it will disable the page content on some sites.  So, you may need to go through and re-enable some of the cookies that you don't recognize, just to read the site.

BTW, this is also a great way to get rid of a lot of ads.  I use it with ublock origin and it's fantastic.

Good luck.  If there are questions, I'll try to reply to some.  If there are too many questions, I will not be able to help everyone expediently.","LPT: on chrome or firefox, use an extension like privacybadger from EFF that lets you selectively block cookies.

"Moving is hella expensive. In Seattle, quotes from most movers for a 1.5 bed/1bath apartment with 3 weeks' storage was around $3-4k. So, we found a company called Clutter (not afraid to name and shame at this point) that quoted around $1.5k. We thought we were saving almost $3k. That was before they lost *over $2,000 worth of our stuff*, including financial documents and identity documents that were held in filing cabinets. 

Now, we're wishing we had just spent that extra money. 

The savings looked good compared to all of the other services, but compared to replacing valuable items, damaged furniture, and personal documents? We're about to be OUT money, even after their abysmal $1k ""insurance"". If we had compared the cost of a higher end mover to the cost of replacing all of those things, it would have made more sense to use a more expensive mover. 

Your things are valuable, sometimes more than can be counted by dollars. If you're giving your things to someone else to care for, like when moving, compare the cost of their services to the cost of replacing all of your stuff; if they come out cheaper than having to replace costly or personally important items, then you're saving money in the end.

"This is a nifty trick that's pretty popular at the college where I'm enrolled. Basically, you buy a digital copy of a textbook and run it through a text to speech program. There's different programs depending on how you want to do it, such as on screen TTS for phones or text-to-mp3 freeware for your computer. Then, you can have your textbook read to you while you're doing chores around the house, going for a walk, or driving to work. regardless of publisher or subject the chapters tend to run between 1-1 1/2 hours, so it can save a ton of time! You'll be surprised how much easier it is to learn too, because for most people it feels more natural to learn by listening than by reading.

While this won't work for every class (especially things that require pictures or long equations), it's been a godsend for my accounting degree.

"Every store has a different price match policy. Walmart has one of the best and will price match any local or legitimate online prices. You don't even need to coupon clip, apps like Flipp allow you to do it on your smart phone.

This doesn't just apply to your PS4 or jeans, stores also price match food. Save yourself the time and gas driving to several different stores and price match at one. You can price match anything from pizza pockets or lettuce to deodorant.

Second LPT is that this applies to generic meats. Local butcher has no name chicken breast on sale dirt cheap but sold out? Price match it. One time I purchased 20 skinless boneless chicken breasts for the same price as 5 would have been.

Third LPT is to check which stores use the Scanning Code of Practice. I believe this is Canadian only but I could be wrong. It's not mandatory and stores can choose to take part. Walmart is one that does take part in this program. What does this mean for you? If the price on the shelf is incorrect, example the shelf price tag says $9.99 but it scans at $14.99 you get the item free if it's under $10 or receive $10 off if the price is above $10.

"OK, so here's a bit of context.

I'm a math teacher. The way the education system works in France, there are three ""tiers"" of teachers.

  \* Contract teachers, hired for a year and rehired as needed.

  \* Certified teachers, hired indefinitely after a ""concours"", ie a contest. A bit like a masters-level exam, but instead of needing a grade to pass, you need to be in the xxx best candidates

  \* Agrégés : there's a second contest, harder than the first (a bit below a doctorate-level maybe?), called the agrégation. There's fewer accepted candidates each year. Those who pass this contest are more likely to be posted in high school rather than middle schools, they get a pay bump, and they have fewer hours. It's a bit unfair to be honest, but I didn't build the system, I just intend to play it.

I am currently a certified teacher, but I got there by taking a year off to study for the first contest, which I can't do anymore. I'd like to study for the agrégation now that I've dedicated 5 years to teaching so as to learn the ropes. the thing is, I have a full-time job (teaching), a part-time job on the side (tutoring) and I have no-one to push me to study, and I live/work in a city too small to have a university - my only resources are the math books I purchased and the internet. As a result, I find it hard to get into the studying mindset, and harder to keep going when I feel like I'm baniging my brain against a wall - the common feeling one has when studying new maths.

So I'm looking for tips and tricks to manage to build a study habit, something resilient enough I can keep on advancing, even slowly, towards the level I need for the exam. Note that I ask every year to be posted in a city with a university so I can enroll (but that I've got a year before the next chance of that happening), and that few, if any, people in my city are studying math at  a level suitable to be a study buddy.

"Reddit is a website for sharing ideas. By knowing you have content that is of value to others, you are motivated to post it to a related Reddit community. When community members read your post, they have an option to upvote or downvote it. Upon receiving your first upvote, you are filled with joy! You conjured a thought from the depths of your mind(or ripped it off another subreddit) and someone actually agrees with it! As more people upvote your post, you feel motivated to make another. After your next post becomes as well received, you are filled with joy again. From, here you make another post. And, the cycle continues! You eventually post so much that it is natural to you. It takes little thought to begin posting again. **This is the development of a habit in action**!

According to Charles Duhigg, author of *The Power of Thought*, habits are adaptive processes that are programmed into the mind through consistent repetition of action. Their primary function is to optimize the amount of energy the brain requires to operate. By recognizing patterns in your behavior, the brain adapts to perform these actions without thought. There are 3 components to a habit: the **cue**, the **routine**, and the **reward**^(1). In the instance of posting to Reddit, the cues are having content worth sharing. The routines are writing (or ripping) a post. And, the rewards are upvotes(acceptance from the community).  The 3 components of a habit flow together into a *habit-loop*, as illustrated below. 

 [https://prnt.sc/khp2su](https://prnt.sc/khp2su) 

It is no mistake that Reddit has an upvote mechanic. Reddit’s karma and trophy system is a form of gamification in social media. Scientific studies have found that gamification does have a **significant** effect on the user. For instance, in a field experiment conducted by professor of gamification, Dr. Juho Hamari, on the effects of gamification, Hamari found there to be 8 reasons for why elements of gamification increases the likelihood of a user to be on a website longer and more often^(2).

These 8 reasons are:

1. They anchor your performance expectations higher
2. Having goals increases your self efficacy
3. Completing goals leads to satisfaction
4. They create goal commitment
5. They act as guidance mechanics and provide feedback
6. They facilitate *psychological flow* through feedback
   1. Psychological flow is “a state of mind characterized by engagement with an activity that is in the sweet spot between effort and ability”
7. They trigger social proof
8. They trigger motivating social comparisons

Of these 8 reasons, 3 of them are most active in Reddit’s system.

These are:

1. They act as guidance mechanics and provide feedback
   1. Guide users to post the most popular content as possible which drives more users to the site.
2. They trigger social proof
   1. Many users go to communities for answers to their problems. If a popular answer works for others, they will believe it will most likely work for them as well.
3. They trigger motivating social comparisons
   1. The karma and trophy system creates a sense of prestige, as long time community members are respected by newer members for being an authority on the subject.

The term *gamification* comes from, *you guessed it*, video games! According to *Webster Dictionary*, *gamification* is the process of adding games or gamelike elements to something (such as a task) so as to encourage participation.

Do you see what is happening here? No? Well, I do!

**Video games are so effective in addicting their users that other industries are adopting their mind-subverting tactics!**

Video games are an industry. The most popular titles are no longer made by nerds in their garages. These days, video games are engineered to be as addicting as possible. Corporations understand the minds of the consumers through market research.They pour millions of dollars into getting inside of the minds of men like you and I. They want to know our biggest fears and motivations so they can design content to simulate solutions to these emotions and keep us playing for hours on end. **This is where elements of gamification work in conjunction with the psychology of habits to create a recipe for mass addiction**.

But, why are men the ones mostly targeted by manipulative corporate marketing? I believe this is because video games are a means of instant-gratification for achievements men would otherwise have to struggle through in order to achieve. Think about it: would you rather explore a new world full of “limitless” opportunities to master many different “skills” or devote years of your life to mastering one specific skill? For the most part, men are the skilled workers that build our world. They fight wars. Build buildings. Lead countries. And, conquer the unknown. But, in the real world, achievement is earned through countless hours of hard work and dedication. While, video games are designed to simulate achievement without requiring too much time or effort to get(psychological flow)2. The easier option video games offers is much more enticing to the minds of many men.

I believe this is best exemplified by the Xbox 360’s, at the time, groundbreaking implementation of in-game achievements. The Xbox 360 spawned a new generation of gamers: *the Achievement Hunters4*. These are players whose motivation to play is earning in-game achievements. Upon earning an in-game achievement, the player earns *Gamerscore* which is summed together and displayed on their *Gamercard*. This simulates qualities of MMO RPGs such as World of Warcraft, which is best known for addicting players so much that they stopped taking care of themselves and died! The gamerscore can be compared to experience points, games become questlines, and the gamertag is the character name. It is the Xbox Live Mass Multiplayer Online Game, *XLMMO**^(4)*.

Although all 8 of Dr Hamari’s reasons apply here, the most significant is number 3: “*completing goals leads to satisfaction*”. This is where the habit-loop comes into play. Upon earning an achievement, the player gets positive reinforcement for unlocking it while playing the game. This motivates them to unlock more achievements(continuing to play the game more). Since many gamers use video games as a compensation mechanism for a lack of success and rewarding relationships in the real world^(3), it is clear that they derive meaning from in-game achievements. With understanding this, the habit-loop becomes very clear.

*The Video Game Habit-Loop:*

**Cue:** Desire for achievement

**Routine:** Playing video games

**Reward:** In-game achievement

 [https://prnt.sc/khp3df](https://prnt.sc/khp3df) 

It is important to note that not every gamer plays for in-game achievements. In fact, there are many that could not care less for them. So, how do these people fit into the habit-loop, with having a desire for achievement? These types of players are likely to be the lonely type. They use the social features in video games to attain social success they would otherwise never have due to social phobia or physical immobility^(3).

The habit-loop is the source of addiction. From consistent success in experiencing the cue, performing the routine, and earning the reward, the mind begins to anticipate the reward at first sight of the cue^(1). This is known as a craving. In the instance of video games, by knowing that you can experience a sensation of achievement, your mind will subconsciously simulate the feeling of reward. That is: **getting the reward without the routine**. This is the emotional motivator that compels the addict to play more and more.

Whether it is earning all the achievements in Halo 27, surviving to round 999,999 with your friends in the 132nd Call of Duty Zombies map, or trolling the little kids on Minecraft, you set out to do something in the hopes of achieving success. Video games were the medium in which you obtained this *achievement*.

So, now that you understand how video games were able to creep their way into your mind, you are likely wondering: *how do I stop playing them*? Unfortunately, you cannot simply stop playing them^(5). You need something to replace them. Think about it like this: if you are playing video games for 8 hours a day, you will need to find something to fill that time. This is where an understanding of habit comes into play. At this point, video games have become a habit.

**In order to break the habit, you need to replace the bad routine with a good one while retaining a similar reward****^(1)**. This can be done with discipline. Each day, you wake up with a limited amount of willpower units. Willpower is your ability to defy your cognitive inclinations(habits). Since willpower is limited, you must use it wisely. You must focus your efforts to changing one habit a time.

This is where you begin your escape from the manipulative grips of video games. You must attack the bad habit at its core by disciplining yourself. It will not be easy at first. But, the longer you persevere, the easier it will get. From my experience with video game addiction, I have found that breaking the video game habit boils down to 4 actions.

1. Identifying the cue, routine, and reward in your video game habit-loop.
2. Defining a purpose.
3. Finding a purpose-oriented routine that gives the same reward.
4. Consistently using the alternative routine to make it a habit.

Below, I have detailed my experience and how each of these 4 actions played a crucial role in breaking my addiction.

# 1. Identifying the Habit-Loop

**Motivation: Before you can change your behavior, you must understand what motivates it.**

For the past few years, I was addicted to Left 4 Dead 2. I would play the competitive mode for up to 8 to 10 hours a day! My biggest motivation to play derived from achievement. **Each match I played was an opportunity to get a dopamine kick from achieving some sort of victory**.

I took this game seriously, with close examination of my win/loss ratio. It was very important to me that I won every game I played. This often resulted in “fixing” games. There were many ways I would do this. Most commonly, I would join a public lobby with 3 of my friends. We would “stack” our team, meaning we 4 knew each other while the other team was a mix of random players. We were guaranteed a win every single time.

This allowed me to create a false perception of skill. Here is an example of my thought process:

“*I have won every single game today. I must be one of the best players!*”.

Essentially, I blinded myself from reality so I could be absorbed with the idea that I was a winner - though I was far from it. With a strike of courage, I saw through my delusion and faced my situation with honesty.

From months of introspection, I realized that I led a meaningless life. The problem lie in my approach to life as a whole. I was a hedonist who sought all forms of instant gratification. Masturbation instead of sex. Sweets and sedentation instead of nutrition and exercise. And, video games instead of responsibility.

I had no drive to do anything with my life. This was the result of being too comfortable. **If you are too comfortable in your current position, you will become complacent and remain where you are**. I was so comfortable because my parents did everything for me. Since I had few responsibilities, I had nothing better to do except play video games all day.

This is how I thought my way out of motivation:

“*I could be achieving a six figure income, running a successful business, but why would I do that? That requires time and effort and I don't even know if I will succeed. Why risk my time and comfort when I can ignore it and enjoy the comfort I have now.*”

By understanding this thought process, I was able to understand that my lack of real world achievement led me to hide in the simulation of achievement that video games offered me. This was merely a bad habit I had to push myself to break.

This is what my habit-loop looked like:

**Cue:** Unoccupied / uninterested mind

**Routine:** Playing Left 4 Dead 2

**Reward:** In-game victory

 [https://prnt.sc/khp47z](https://prnt.sc/khp47z) 

What I needed was a drive to rise above my situation. This is something I will touch on in the next point.

# 2. Defining a Purpose

**Motivation: You must have a burning desire to fulfill a purpose. You must know what you are aiming for. This is because you will not be willing to endure an extreme amount of discomfort without a reason to justify.**

To my dismay, once I understood the root of my problem, nothing changed! I went on for months, hating myself each time I fell back into my video game habit. When I was not home, they never crossed my mind. But, at night, when I was in my room, all by myself, the craving got to me and I loaded Left 4 Dead 2 up instead of studying.

**At this point, I had no drive to fight the urges. That was soon to change.**

It is important to note that I do not come from a stable family. My parents are divorced and I live with my mom and my younger brother. We do not have the nicest things in the world, but we are happy with what we have. In the past year, my brother’s mental health has taken a turn for the worse. He stopped going to school and taking care of himself. Even worse, he began consistent drug abuse. This behavior has driven a wedge between himself and the rest of the family. It has made living as a whole much more difficult.

During the course of his devolution, I was blind. My relationship with my brother gradually died because I was too occupied with video games to be interested in his life. Sure, I would interact with him and his friends, but there was no relationship. I would just sit there and watch them play video games. My brother and I previously had a relationship because of video games. We played Minecraft together exclusively. Having a similar hobby, we shared many stories that brought us together. Though these memories are almost 6 years old, we still relate with them to this day.

At first, when I became conscious of my brother’s new lifestyle, I tolerated it. I allowed him to go down the drug-fueled path of destruction. Hell, I actually participated in it with him. But, there was a line I was not willing to pass: illegal prescription drug use. He passed it, leaving me to retract from the lifestyle all together. Having witnessed how far he devolved, I became disturbed. The brother I grew up with, the brother I loved with all my heart was in a world of pain and there was nothing I could do about it, well so I thought.

My brother’s situation was a blessing in disguise. The disturbed thoughts drove me to swear to myself that I would be the best not only for him, but my broken family as a whole. My purpose was to provide for my family. **At the snap of a finger, I stopped playing video games**. I viewed them as an obstacle to the future I had visioned. My heart was ignited with a roaring fire to endure any and all suffering in order to protect my family. I knew I had to be strong to protect them. This meant going to school to have a high paying job in order to be financially secure(financially strong), going to the gym to build my body(physically strong), and persevering through it all(mentally strong). I had to grow from being a boy to being a man.

**I became obsessed with making my transition from boyhood to manhood, because I knew my family needed a man to step up and bear the pain for the betterment of all**.

I got a job and began financially contributing to the family. I took time out of my day to interact with them, talking to them as we cooked and cleaned together. I began learning everyday life skills from them, such as how to cook pork chops and and how to maintain a household. By adding these skills to my tool-kit, I was able to ease my family’s burdens by being able to perform them myself, allowing them to rest.

While the well-being of my family was my primary motivator, I was doing this for myself. I understood that having life skills allowed me to offer others value. I believe a man is only as loved as he is valuable. Men are the ones who endure pain for the good of all.

This experience reminds me of a quote from my favorite TV show, *Breaking Bad*. Walter White’s greatest enemy, Gus Fring, relates with him in regards to being a man and providing for a family. In a conversation between the two men, Gus says, “A man provides for his family. And, he does it even when he is not appreciated. Or respected. Or even **loved**. He simply bears up and does it, because he’s a man.”.

**I chose to be a man because of the pain, not despite of it.**

# 3. Finding a Purpose-Oriented Routine

**Motivation: In order to beat the bad habit, you must replace the bad routine with a good one**^(1)**. By knowing what you are aiming for, you can find a proper replacement routine that satisfies both the habit and your purpose.**

For me, finding a purpose to change myself was **very** difficult. It was supposed to be! Going from a hedonistic, instant-gratification-seeking child to a responsibility-seeking man was no simple feat. It required me to deconstruct the life I knew and to rebuild it from nothing, all on my own!

I started small by making my bed everyday. Then, I started walking my dog everyday. Next, chiseling my bedtime down from 1:30 AM to 8:30 PM, so I could wake up at 4:30 AM to work on myself. From there, I started going to the gym as soon as I woke up, 3 times a week.

**I am continuously getting better.** This mindset was the key to my video game addiction. By pushing myself to be better everyday, I accomplish something everyday. I have found a new source of achievement in my life. One far more fulfilling and fruitful than the simulated sensation video games gave me.

While I achieve something in each area of my life, here is the new habit-loop, with a replacement routine in the instance of achieving the body of my dreams.

**Cue:** Unoccupied mind

**Routine:** Going to the gym

**Reward:** Muscle growth and physical aesthetic

 [https://prnt.sc/khp4ru](https://prnt.sc/khp4ru) 

This loop works because I understand that I have nothing better to do with my time other than make productive use of it.

# 4. Consistently Maintaining New Routine

**Motivation: Breaking the old habit requires you to build the new habit. You must consistently perform the new routine to program it into your subconscious mind.**

I believe consistency can be easy if you have the right mindset. Although I was removing video games from my life, my approach to solving my addiction was inspired by them. I chose my goals and inadvertently adopted many of gamification elements that Dr. Hamari’s research showed to improve participation.

These were:

1. Having goals increases your self efficacy
   1. By seeing others achieve their own success, I wrote down my goals knowing if they could be successful, so could I.
2. They create goal commitment
   1. I wrote down my goals and put them on my desk, so I see them everyday.
   2. I committed to a measurable goal.
3. They act as guidance mechanics and provide feedback
   1. If I do not meet my goal deadline, I access my situation and see what is holding me back.
4. They trigger social proof
   1. I surrounded myself with people who are as motivated as myself. Because my environment only displayed a motivated lifestyle, all I could possibly think and do was to better myself.

Instead of building a video game character, I was building myself. I started to view each task in life as a skill that I could master. For instance, in building my body, I viewed my current body as having developed a quantified level of strength and aesthetic. Something that could be improved with *grinding*. Each time I leveled up(lifted heavier weights), the difficulty increased. I would have to eat more and train harder to see the same progression. I viewed the “level” of my body as a position on a spectrum of mastery. Mastery being my end goal of weighing 200 lbs in muscle mass.

 [https://prnt.sc/khp5ai](https://prnt.sc/khp5ai) 

**What I had was an achievement mindset. Even when I failed, I looked for a positive outlook on the situation. This is a habit of thought. The more you look for the positive side of a situation, the more inclined your mind will be to find it without conscious thought.**

In the instance of going to the gym, It took about a month of going consistently before it was rooted into my mind. At that point, waking up at 4:30 AM and driving to the gym was no longer a struggle. It was something I *just* did. It had become a habit!

# Conclusion

You can break free of your addiction! I know you can because I myself have! The approach I outlined in this post is based upon the idea of “**work smart, not hard**”. While you can arbitrarily discipline yourself, you will be fighting an uphill battle. By first defining a burning desire to fulfill a purpose, you will overcome your addiction with greater ease. I am not saying it will be easy, but I believe you will have greater success with this approach.

With that being said, your biggest struggle will be finding a purpose to change. This varies from person to person, so there is no one generic solution. However, there is an approach that you all can use: **writing**. You do not necessarily have to have a journal. But, rather, you want to write something similar to what I wrote in 4-actions segment of this post.

Here is an outline to get started:

1. Write down your goals
   1. Put them where you can see them everyday
2. Write down all the qualities that you believe are preventing you from attaining these goals
   1. Video game addiction, masturbation addiction, poor school grades, etc
3. Think about why you possess these qualities
   1. You may find that many of your qualities exist because of one problem
   2. Or, one may be causing another
      1. Masturbation zaps your energy, making you more likely to be sedentary and play video games / not study
4. Outline a specific situation where a specific quality disadvantaged you
   1. As you write, keep these questions in mind:
      1. Who did this situation involve?
      2. When did it happen?
      3. Why did possessing this quality disadvantage me?
      4. What can I learn from this experience so I can perform better next time?
      5. How can I experience a similar situation to test my growth?
5. Write, with complete sentences, with emphasis on analysis of the quality and the situation
   1. Write it like a story

By doing this, you will become more aware of yourself. You will see patterns in your behavior and discover why you are who you are.

If you want to go the extra mile, write an autobiography. Start with a specific situation in your life and expand out from there(the outline above is a good start). Define chapters of your life, where you highlight themes in your behavior and emotions in that time.

In order to know where you are going, you must know where you have been. **You must first understand what makes you who you are so you can find a specific solution to each of your problems.**.

I know you can do it my friend. :)

Best,

*Gandamede*

# TL;DR

Video games are designed to be addictive. By subverting your mind and making them habit, they subconsciously manipulate your mind to continue to play. It is by attacking the habit at its roots that you will break free of your addiction. In order to do this, you must understand how habits work.

Habits are adaptive processes that are programmed into the mind through consistent repetition of action. Their primary function is to optimize the amount of energy the brain requires to operate. By recognizing patterns in your behavior, the brain adapts to perform these actions without thought. There are 3 components to a habit: the **cue**, the **routine**, and the **reward**^(1).

How to overcome your video game addiction:

1. Identify the cue, routine, and reward

"I believe this tip has been hidden from people with very serious health conditions caused be the typical western diet because doctors would rather sell drugs instead of promote a healthy diet. On average the western diet leads the public to having twice-three times the recommended cholesterol levels. *I have a ton of health tips that I would like to share, but let's see how this one is received first:*

Eating Indian Gooseberry (Amla) has a greater cholesterol lowering effect than statins do as shown in clinical studies. Brazil nuts are also a close comparison for lowering cholesterol. A good way of keeping cholesterol to the natural healthy levels is simply not eating dietary cholesterol (animals) because our body produces enough with plant based diets.

Talking it out helps us process what has happened in a healthy manner, and can stop these issues manifesting and taking hold.

It's easier for other people to spot our behavioral changes over time, than it is for ourselves. We all undergo stress, anxiety, tragedy, depression etc and there should be no shame in it.

Stuff you'll need:
-basic rubbing alcohol that you probably have already
-dropper
-toothpicks 
-qtips

Sweep excess powder into the pans. Drip alcohol a little bit at a time...it will probably take more fluid than you think, but go slow. Stir the alcohol with a toothpick into the powder, cleaning up edges as you go with the qtip, and gently tapping the pans on the table to make any bubbles rise and to smooth the surface. Let it dry a little then take it outside and blow excess powder off the palette. Then put it somewhere to dry. It will dry pretty quick. 

That's it! So quick and easy.

"Currently writing to you from an abandoned Acer 4720z - released between 2006-2008, and famously part of a class action suit because it didn't ship with enough RAM to handle the original Windows Vista OS.

Bodhi Linux makes it handle like a brand new laptop. I still get requests for the details behind another LPT - which was deleted for recommending a branded service in the title. So, in no certain order, here are the lightweight OSs I've tested. All have improved comparatively ancient laptops I was ready to toss, and in some cases turned them into pretty capable back-up work computers.

In all but the oldest computers, the process is simple - download the new OS from its website, burn the .iso image to a flash drive, pop it in, hit whatever key you need to upon start-up to enter the boot menu, and then boot from the USB. I've only encountered two computers so far - both ancient desktops with tape (!) drives installed - that would not boot from a USB...and even those you can force boot from a CD, instead. 

-Bodhi Linux - bare bones, very fast, interesting desktop environment. You'll have to install a lot of extras like office software, but that's part of what makes it so good for older computers. 

-Neverware's CloudReady. The subject of the old, deleted LPT post. Neverware takes old laptops and puts a version of the Chrome OS on them, basically turning them into pretty powerful (but battery hungry) Chromebooks. Their main market is schools/institutions, but the personal version is free.

-Peppermint Linux - An alternative to CloudReady above - lightweight linux distro geared for Chromebook-like use, with most applications run from the cloud. 
 
- Linux Mint XFCE - Lightweight version of the popular Linux Mint OS. 

-Lubuntu - Lightweight Ubuntu. YMMV, but I was the least impressed with this one. Bodhi Linux improved the speed considerably, and Linux Mint operated a tad faster with the same functionality. 

-Tiny Linux - Extremely bare bones - down to the need to install wifi drivers/etc - but you can cheat and just go with the Tiny Linux Plus option, which gets you up and running about on-par with Bodhi Linux (minus some important stuff, like a file manager...this one is for extreme cases or fun DIY projects)

"What you're going to do is develop ***real consequences*** for skipping the gym that your future-self won't be able to avoid. That guilty feeling for skipping the gym isn't as consequential as having to donate $25-$100 to the Red Cross because you were too lazy to do a few burpees.  
  
Think of a friend who doesn't tolerate bullshit and is willing to help you out. Tell this friend that you're determined to start going to the gym and ask them to keep you accountable. Tell them that you will be going to the gym on Mon/Wed/Fri (or whatever days you plan to go). **You will prove you went to the gym by taking a picture of yourself at the gym and sending it to them. If you do not send that picture to them then you're then obligated to donate $25 to a charity of your friend's choice, and you'll have to send them the electronic receipt to prove you donated that money.**  
  
So you're pretty much putting your future-self in a position where you can either fork over $25 (or however much you and your friend agree upon) or just go to the damn gym. If $25 isn't motivating enough then increase it to $50, or however much you're unwilling to part with just to avoid the gym. ***Just make sure you pick a friend who won't tolerate bullshit excuses or is too lazy to hold you accountable!***  
  
If you think your future-self might be sleazy and decide to take multiple photos to send at later dates to fool your friend, or refuse to donate that money, or continually comes up with semi-valid excuses for skipping (feeling ill, too busy, have an appointment, etc.), then think those scenarios through and develop a foolproof agreement between you and your friend that circumvents your future-self's possible schemes. There're methods other than pictures to prove you went to the gym (sending your GPS tag to your friend, asking your gym to print your attendance log for you, etc.). You can give your friend something valuable of yours to hold hostage if you refuse to stand by your agreement. You can agree to donate (less) money even when your excuse for skipping is %100 concrete and justified.","LPT: If you're constantly making excuses to not go to the gym, have a friend hold you accountable by charging you money each time you don't go.",self.LifeProTips,1531625188,3,LifeProTips,True,2018-07-14

"5.6159997e+16

I got this number by following a damage formula, these this formula is not 100% accurate apparently, but pretty damn close. It goes

Damage (Attack command) = (2*offense_stat - DEF)/5
Damage (Skills/Spells) = 1.5 * (2*offense_stat*skill_mult - defense_stat) * skill_upgrade_mult / 5

offense_stat := For weapons, the stats the weapon uses, INT for magic
defense_stat := DEF for physical attacks, RES for magical attacks
skill_mult := The base multiplier of the skill. This is what is indicated by the letters F-S. For example, F skills have a skill_mult of between 1 and 1.25.
skill_upgrade_mult := The multiplier of the rank of the skill. This is the percentage listed. For example, +1 skills have a skill_upgrade_mult of 120% or 1.2.

As for skill_mult, I only know that F is 1.0-1.25, E is 1.25-1.5, and D is 1.5-2. Don't have any higher skills than that at the moment. (Well I have some Cs, so I know that goes up to at least 2.15.) If anyone knows/figures out the rest, I would love to know!

Crits multiply offense_stat by 1.5. Nicks multiply offense_stat by 0.5.

All of this is extra, just adding some context. But google gave me a number I don't know how to read, I think it has something to do with powers, but Im not math wiz.

"Hey, so I wanted to know a little about longitudinal waves vs. transverse waves. I am not a learning scientist or know anything about their independent formulas.

Please let me know that as a person or musician when I plucky a string we achieve a transverse wave (please, forgive and correct me if I am wrong) and what about longitudinal waves? I have a friend who is a physicist, and he told me and I quote, ""Longitudinal waves would not change the shape of the string, just its relative density and changes therein, which propagate in waves along the string's length. Compression and rarefaction of the string's material.”

She texts it via Apple IOS and not via Facebook Messenger.  Again, it is not a link to the store she sent but rather a jpg capture of the page she was looking at.  I didn't click on the picture to even open it further...just viewed in the text thread.

But yet the very next time I open Facebook, the very first ad is for this store and for a dress very similar in style to the one she showed me.

How does Facebook access my IOS messenger, interpret a jpg screen capture to identify the retailer and dress style and then show me ads that relate?

"For an assignment I have use the GBP Trade-weighted effective exchange rate index and run a regression against companies' stock returns to figure out how much it affects them.

The issue is that I can't seem to figure out how to interpret this index.
At first I assumed that a rise in this index would mean an appreciation of the local currency against its trading partners' currencies. However, the assignment is based on a paper by He&amp;Ng (1998) where they explain the index as follows: rxt is the rate of return on a trade-weighted exchange rate index, measured as the Japanese yen price of the foreign currency. 

This seems to suggest that the index means ""I have to pay this many Yen to buy this basket of foreign currency"", which is the exact opposite of my initial interpretation (and the explanation the internet seems to provide).

So my question is:

If the UK £ Trade Weighted Effective Index (BOE) rises, does that mean the £ appreciates or depreciates?

Discontinuance of Accessory Classifications Effective Immediately: The Firearms Technology Industry Services Branch (FTISB) classifies firearms as defined by the Gun Control Act (GCA) and National Firearms Act (NFA) based on the configuration and the design features of the firearm as submitted by members of the industry.

Effective immediately, any requests for a determination on how an accessory affects the classification of a firearm under the GCA or NFA must include a firearm with the accessory already installed. Except in cases of conditional import determinations, FTISB will not issue a determination on an accessory unless it is attached to the submitted firearm.

If you have previously submitted a sample accessory for classification, FTISB will be returning your sample without classification. FTISB will contact you in the near future with further instructions to facilitate the return of your sample.

"I was watching Apocalypse Now and one of the characters says that ""Arc Light ... will suck the air out of your d--n lungs."" Arc Light is basically bombs dropped by B-52s.

I actually did search this subreddit and found [this explanation](https://redd.it/63xzxi). However, I'm still confused about what is making what compress and decompress.

The explainer wrote: ""Any cavities in your body with gas will compress suddenly, then just as suddenly decompress.""

Wouldn't they expand (decompress) first with the pressure wave, and then compress with the vacuum after the pressure wave?

My first understanding is as follows:

1. The pressure wave reaches your body.
2. The pressure wave increases the pressure of the air in lungs, which may cause the air and your lungs to expand from forces **inside** your body and rupture.
3. The vacuum behind the pressure wave will decrease the pressure in your lungs, causing your lungs to compress.

My alternative understanding is as follows:

1. The pressure wave reaches your body.
2. The pressure wave hits your chest so hard that it causes your chest to compress from forces **outside** your body, and therefore your lungs as well, squeezing the air out of you.
3. Your lungs expand and may overcompensate, causing your lungs to rupture.

Which of my two understanding is accurate? Both seem to make sense to me from a physical perspective, but I really don't know which one is better.

This is a biophysical problem; I've put this in physics, not biology, since I see it more as a physical problem.

"I've seen some content online about how certain parasites control the behavior of their insect hosts, like the jeweled cockroach wasp or whatever species is in [this](https://youtu.be/vMG-LWyNcAs) video.

My question is how these parasites are able to reprogram their hosts so well. In the case of the jeweled cockroach wasp, it seems like the wasp fiddles with a few key areas of the cockroaches brain, then poof-the cockroach has no more motivation. In the video, the caterpillar seems to know what the larvae cocoons are and protects them.

How can it be that simple? Is removing the motivation from a cockroach really as simple as just cutting a few connections in the brain? Is it easy to make a caterpillar think ""must protect yellow lump""? I would think that these tasks would be really complicated, so how are these parasites able to complete them so effortlessly?

"If illicit drugs (heroin, cocaine, marijuana) are illegal to have in your possession, then how are substance use treatment centers able to exist? There are people who use illicit drugs despite knowing the consequences, is it because they are not the ones treated at these centers? Middle-class, suburban areas have prevalent drug use, but they are able to use drug treatment or counseling to improve themselves. Yet, we don't see all drug users being arrested for possession, despite knowing that they have used illicit drugs. However, wherever drug use cases are reported, they are known to be known for drug use, so we often see these people incarcerated bc they are unable to pay possession fines...I guess what I'm trying to say is: Why do we incarcerate some people for using illicit drugs but allow others to go to treatment centers and not get arrested despite doing the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

The following paragraph explains what I'm talking about better than myself:

&amp;#x200B;

The communities reporting drug use are not the only ones typically considered to be high drug traffic areas: drug use is prevalent in suburban, middle-class areas around the country as well as in rural settings and in cities. However, suburban police presence is largely concerned with the residents’ desire to keep the “bad element” out rather than turn attention to its own citizens.

"**Read First** : Please, I really don't want this thread to devolve into a bitch fest, I'm genuinely trying to understand the referenced ""law"" and the logic behind creating it.


In this post, [Lindsey Graham](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9vvm6x/lindsey_graham_says_democrats_push_to_count_all/) states that counting of votes needs to happen within a narrow time window, otherwise the votes are not to be considered.

Why?  What is the point of this law in the first place?  I mean, there had to be some reasoning (flawed, malevolent, honest fix, who knows) behind creating it.

The only reasons I can guess at seem completely silly.

Serious replies... please.

"Hello. I understand the point of arranged marriage in general. I can even understand a loveless, arranged marriage. 

I don't understand the business point of loveless, untrusting, arranged marriage as a way to guarantee loyalty though. 

History teaches us that even father and son (or more commonly, uncle and nephew) betray or wage war against each other all the time. 

How can a family that is bonded by loveless and untrusting fare better?

If there is existing trust between family, how can forcing marriage be prudent? I would be pissed if anyone cheated on my child. A lot of loving couples cheat. I can't imagine that a loveless couples fare better.

Arranged marriage is often portrayed as calculative, but that doesn't make much sense. If I see my child as a resource, why would I care if I betray my grandchild's family? My grandchild is my resource after all.

---

I occasionally articulate to my family (who pressure me to find a girlfriend) that I'm ok with arranged marriage. (I'm Thai so it's quite rare but not that unheard of. I have a cousin who marry this way.) 

They don't believe me that I'm open to arranged marriage. 

I argue that since it's extremely unlikely that anyone will love me, it's extremely unlikely that I will get marry. I therefore allow them to use my marriage as they see fit. I can't think of any benefit of marrying me though.

So as I understand, you're effectively required to have health insurance in America, because all prices are based on the assumption that you have insurance. I'm going to be saying some stuff, please tell me which are wrong

1. The price of treatment is $1000. Insurance will help you pay $999. But the hospital gives them a discount to only pay $10, for $11 total, because the treatment really costs them $5, all overheads included.
2. If you do have insurance, everything is fine
3. If you don't have insurance, you're fucked
4. If you're too poor to pay for insurance, you're fucked

If all of these are true, then I can see what was intended. It's not a great system because poverty is in fact a thing, but I can at least tell what it's supposed to be. If 2 is false (I have it on good authority that 1,3,4 are completely true), then I have no idea what they were trying to do. Are you just fucked no matter what? That also can't possibly be true.

"I just finished reading *Into the Wild.* As much as McCandless' journey was interesting, what really fascinated me was one of the last few chapters, in which the author Krakauer explains his experience of climbing the Devil's Thumb (AK).

I've traveled a lot (backpacking style although not as extreme as McCandless) and hiking/camping is my all I want to do if I don't have to work. But I never got around climbing including indoor rock climbing. - I'm not a fan of any indoor ""imitation"" sports. 

I've read articles in the past about a team of alpinists ""conquers"" Mt.Everest or some other notoriously dangerous, challenging mountains around the world. Usually those articles include a picture of two of them hanging by a rope which I never questioned how until I read this book. 

[This webpage](http://www.colinhaley.com/devils-thumb-the-diablo-traverse/) shows 2 people climbing the Devil's Thumb and they are on the rope. 

To me these are great example photos because I don't see how far the rope is hung from which makes me think it's probably not within a reach. 

I don't even know how you hang the rope in the first place. I always thought maybe when they are dropped off by a helicopter someone attach the rope on the top? (sounds stupid...) or they don't always use the rope?

Since Krakauer was alone, how and who attached the rope on the top or at least farther up? Did he not use the rope at all?

How does the rope work in mountain climbing and who attach them on the rock wall?

I'd assume that it's insane to try to climb without a rope because it seems to be like a safety belt?

"I saw at /r/travel on here something stating that there was no obligation for firms to use the current exchange rate and they could use their own in-house ones.

I also read in an Australian automobile magazine that some firms freeze the exchange rate for AUD/USD [or AUD/EUR] for car pricing as obviously, car prices can't fluctuate with the exchange rates.

For example, if Ford was to sell the Explorer 3.5 V6 Platinum 4x4 4-door crossover SUV in Australia [which goes for $53,940 in USD], at current exchange rates it would go for $75,836 [with LCT luxury car tax it would be $100,862, as they do in Australia with vehicles over $33,000], going with the 1 USD = $1.41 AUD.

&gt; An operational definition is the articulation of operationalization (or statement of procedures) used in defining the terms of a process (or set of validation tests) needed to determine the nature of an item or phenomenon (a variable, term, or object) and its properties such as duration, quantity, extension in space, chemical composition, etc

Both the Roci, along with the likes of Serenity from Firefly, are very much a Space Shuttle style with a very clear front and back - nose-cone and rear engine.

I'm going to pose a small scenario. Take a shoebox and lay it on the floor. One end is now The Front and the other is The Back, where the engine is. The Lid is the ceiling and The Bottom is, you guessed it, the bottom. Assuming that the good ship HMS Hoebox is travelling parallel to the floor in a 0G/microgravity environment, would the thrust push the crew down towards The Bottom of the ship or back to The Back of the ship?

Now, I'm thinking aspirine in 80mg doses should remedy this, and you'd be left with only positive effects alltogether.

The [Parker Solar Probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe) was launched into space today and will probably take super cool photos of the sun and stuff. Officially NASA wanted to launch it yesterday, but they cancelled it minutes before the countdown because of irregularities.

So what I **am** knowing is that such spacecrafts have some sort of ""predefined"" orbit calculated. This one hasn't really an orbit I think, it ""just"" flys by the sun, but still, the plan from NASA is to use the gravity from Venus to get their faster or so. Which really left me wondering, how? Like launching your rocket one day after scheduled is no problem? I mean, one day passed, so things in space are a little bit different, right?

"So, if someone who knows a thing or two about International Law(because I don't) could explain me this, that would be great.

So, if you don't know/care about Romania's current situation, I'll explain you a bit. Basically there have been massive protests against corruption and the current government for the past two years. Now, a bit of tension and agitation here and there during protests is nothing unheard of, but recently it got way out of hand, leaving hundreds injured.

The Jandarmerie(i.e. Romanian Riot Police) physically abused the (peaceful) protesters during last night and the other night's protester. They went as far as to use tear gas and rubber bullets, and little did they care that there were also children and old people in the crowd. Of course, they received those orders not necessarily from the currently ruling political party, but at least from people that were strongly affiliated with it. These events are comparable to the Mineriads ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineriad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineriad)), which are considered to be one of the worst events in recent Romanian history.

So, my question is: Why doesn't the ICC do anything about this? There are a lot of reasons that would make this case eligible for an ICC conviction: First of all, those have to be classified as crimes against humanity. Second of all, the Romanian Court is unwilling/unable to do anything about this(well, I'd say the former rather than the latter, but that's a different story). Not to mention that Romania is a member of both the  UN and the ICC, as well as the EU(if that helps with anything in this matter).

**2. iCarly**

- When they became a TV show, Freddy was their Supervising Producer, they made all sorts of jokes about all the dumb meaningless shit he has to do

- They name dropped him as things in the show, like a hotdog place called ""Robin's Weiners"", (his name is Robin Weiner)

"So let me explain my question a little bit. From my understanding we are storing fat on our bodies because in the past food has always been scarce, so we developed a way to get around this by storing every extra calorie on our bodies. 

So if we will have generation after generation of obese people will this make our bodies adapt to the abundance of food and stop the storing process? Also will it make it so that low calorie foods will taste better? Lastly aproximately how many obese generations will be required for this adaptation?
